## Configuring Language Pack

The STDF component uses Svelte's [Context](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/context) to implement internationalization configuration of text, with the default configuration being in Simplified Chinese. Usually, the Context is configured in the entry file `App.svelte` or `+layout.svelte`. For example:

```svelte
<!-- App.svelte/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
	import { setContext } from 'svelte'; // import setContext
	import { en_US } from 'stdf/lang'; // import language file

	setContext('STDF_lang', en_US); // set language
</script>
```

All child components of this component (including STDF components) can obtain the current language configuration using `getContext('STDF_lang')`. More flexible is that another language can be configured in some parts of the application.

Note that **Context switching is not reactive**, and language switching in most applications does not require real-time response.

## Adding a Language Pack
<!-- main -> next -->
If you cannot find the language pack you need, you are welcome to create a new language pack based on the [Chinese language pack](https://github.com/any-tdf/stdf/blob/next/packages/stdf/src/lib/lang/zh_CN.ts) or [English language pack](https://github.com/any-tdf/stdf/blob/next/packages/stdf/src/lib/lang/en_US.ts) and submit it as a Pull Request. [Language code table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)

The basic steps are as follows:

- Please fork the [STDF](https://github.com/any-tdf/stdf) code to your own repository. If you have already forked it, please sync the latest code from the main repository.
- Clone your repository to your local machine.
- Add language packs in the `packages/stdf/src/lib/lang` folder.
- (Optional) Update the documentation. Update the [internation.md](https://github.com/any-tdf/stdf/edit/next/docs/mds/guide/internation.md) and [internation_en.md](https://github.com/any-tdf/stdf/edit/next/docs/mds/guide/internation_en.md) files in the docs/mds/guide folder. Please update them in alphabetical order according to the lang list.
- Commit the modifications to your repository and then submit a Pull Request to the main repository.
- Once the Pull Request is approved during the review process, it will be merged into the main repository and a new version will be released on npm.
