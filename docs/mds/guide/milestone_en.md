New folder created.

As early as 2021 when developing [simple-cloud-music](https://github.com/dufu1991/simple-cloud-music), I found that writing Svelte was very enjoyable but there seemed to be no mobile-oriented UI component libraries on the market.

Therefore I decided to use Svelte combined with Tailwind to develop a mobile-oriented UI component library.
