## STDF Name

Generally speaking, S stands for Simple, T stands for Thin, D stands for Design, and F stands for Fast. So, STDF is a simple, lightweight, design-friendly, and fast UI component library.

Unconventional explanation: S and T stand for Svelte and Tailwind respectively, because STDF is based on Svelte and Tailwind. DF can be seen as the poet Du Fu, who is not as romantic and elegant as Li Bai. He pays attention to practicality and ease of use, which is also the design concept of STDF. I hope that every developer who uses STDF can write code like a poem.

## Why Create This Library

First and foremost, it's to complement the Svelte ecosystem.

Regarding UI component libraries, there are many excellent products for PC, but there aren't many on the mobile side that can match the PC level. This is due to the unique characteristics of the mobile side. Most mobile products are To C businesses, which require higher flexibility in component libraries. When designing component APIs, more parameter support for configuration is required, but it cannot be designed to be too complex. In terms of UI design, there should not be too many personalized designs so that component reuse can be achieved.

There are also many mobile component libraries on the market, but there are still many pain points in use. For example, some component library design styles are too personalized, resulting in low component reuse. Some component libraries have too few configurable APIs and cannot configure components that meet business requirements through a simple API. Some component library documentation is either too advanced or too rudimentary, making it difficult for beginners to understand how to use the components. Some component library documentation and demo are mixed with Chinese and English, making it difficult to browse. Some component library demos are too few or too simple, making it difficult to directly copy and use when used frequently, which reduces development efficiency, and so on.

After experiencing Svelte and Tailwind, I found that developing with them is really comfortable, so I thought about combining them to create a mobile UI component library. In this way, we can enjoy the development experience brought by Svelte and Tailwind on the mobile side too.

## Applicable Scenarios

There is a mobile business scenario where the application is not too complex, and developing with Vue or React may appear to be "overkill." The entire application package JS size may only be a few tens of KB, but using Vue or React would result in the base sizes of these two libraries exceeding tens of KB, which would be too costly. Additionally, it is not desirable to have a large volume of To C applications on mobile platforms. However, developing with pure native JS would appear to be inefficient. In such cases, Svelte is a good choice. Its concise syntax gives native JS code responsive capabilities.
